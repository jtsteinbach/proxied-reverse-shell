# NetNinja: Encrypted Reverse Shell with Proxying

**NetNinja** is a secure, encrypted reverse shell tool that utilizes proxying for enhanced privacy and security. It consists of two main components: a **server script** (handled via Python and Docker) for managing connections, routing, and encryption, and a **client script** for establishing and managing connections. NetNinja is designed for ethical use in penetration testing, remote administration, and educational purposes.

## Features

- **Encrypted Communication**: All data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using robust cryptographic protocols.
- **Proxied Connections**: Connections are routed through a proxy for added anonymity and security.
- **Multi-Threading**: Supports concurrent command execution and response handling.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any system with Python 3.7+ installed.
- **Persistent Connections**: Supports persistent connections for long-term operations (WIP).
- **Easy to Use**: Intuitive command-line interface with detailed usage instructions.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Docker (for server setup)
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)

---

## Usage

### Client Commands

#### Start as Receiver (Listen for Connections)
```bash
./netninja_client.py -o <port> [-s]
```
- `<port>`: The port to listen on.
- `-s`: Optional flag to run in silent mode (suppresses output).

#### Connect as Sender
```bash
./netninja_client.py -c <connection_code>
```
- `<connection_code>`: The code generated by the receiver.

#### Update Client
```bash
./netninja_client.py -update
```
Updates the client to the latest version.

---

## Example Workflow

1. **Start the Receiver**:
   ```bash
   ./netninja_client.py -o 8080
   ```
   This generates a connection code and listens for incoming connections.

2. **Connect as Sender**:
   ```bash
   ./netninja_client.py -c ABC123
   ```
   Replace `ABC123` with the connection code provided by the receiver.

3. **Execute Commands**:
   Once connected, the sender can execute commands on the receiver's machine. For example:
   ```
   >> ls -la
   >> whoami
   ```

4. **Terminate Session**:
   Type `exit` to close the session.

## Security Considerations

- **Encryption**: All communication is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.
- **Proxying**: Connections are routed through a proxy to obscure the client's identity.
- **Ethical Use**: NetNinja is intended for legal and ethical purposes only. Misuse of this tool is strictly prohibited.
